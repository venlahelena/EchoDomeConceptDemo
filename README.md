# 🌱 Echo Dome – Proof of Concept Demo

**Echo Dome** is a narrative-driven 2D exploration game built in Unity. Set inside a sealed biosphere after a failed sustainability experiment, the player explores, interacts, and uncovers the story of a troubled mission. The game emphasizes **environmental storytelling**, **emotional agency**, and **atmosphere over action**.

> 📌 Success isn’t survival — it’s understanding.

## 🧪 Narrative & Gameplay Concept

You are part of **Experiment 3**, humanity’s last chance to prove life can thrive in a closed system. Something is going wrong, systems are failing, the crew is at each other’s throats, and all that’s left is to stabilize what you can... and figure out **why** it failed.

- Environmental storytelling via objects, logs, and system decay  
- No win state — only discovery and emotional progression  
- Player delays the inevitable collapse to unlock more story  
- NPCs respond to system health and player decisions  
- Emotional tone changes with performance and choices

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Unity 2D  
- C#  
- Git + GitHub for version control

---

## 🎯 Next Development Goals

- Add 2–3 more interactables with unique narrative content  
- Create a second room (e.g., greenhouse) and transitions  
- Implement oxygen % and system degradation over time  
- Scaffold NPC logic and trigger-based dialogue  
- Begin narrative pacing using terminals, logs, and plant states
